Background (from web research):

INTELLIGENCE GAP:

in the collected data. This represents a potential investigation target.

SECTION 6: POTENTIAL FINANCIAL LINKS (REQUIRES FURTHER INVESTIGATION)
================================================================================

HYPOTHESIS: Alex Saab -> Etka/Megasis Connection
-------------------------------------------------
Evidence supporting potential connection:
1. Alex Saab ran CLAP food distribution (government food program)
2. Alex Saab owns ASASI FOOD FZE (sanctioned food import company)
3. Megasis is an Iranian government store selling food products
4. Alex Saab is now Minister of Industries overseeing imports

MISSING EVIDENCE NEEDED:
- Direct financial transactions between Saab entities and Etka
- Bank records showing payments
- Shipping manifests linking Megasis products to Saab's network
- Corporate registration documents showing ownership ties

================================================================================
SECTION 7: COMPANIES NOT ON OFAC (INVESTIGATION TARGETS)
================================================================================

These entities appear in Venezuela-Iran context but are NOT yet sanctioned:

1. MEGASIS SUPERMARKET - Caracas
2. ETKA ORGANIZATION - Iranian parent company
3. Unnamed "international investors" in Motor Industrial program
4. Companies receiving $1.4B in industrial alliances via Saab's ministry

================================================================================
SECTION 8: INFRASTRUCTURE INTELLIGENCE
================================================================================

Internal IPs leaked from Venezuelan state media:
- 190.202.124.19 (Correo del Orinoco production server)
- 201.243.95.29 (Website infrastructure)

These IPs appear in schema.org data across all Hez folder files.

================================================================================
CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

1. MEGASIS is NOT on OFAC despite documented IRGC/Etka connection

2. ALEX SAAB remains the most significant financial link between Venezuela
   and Iran/Hezbollah interests, despite being sanctioned he now controls
   Venezuela's industrial ministry

3. No DEFINITIVE financial transaction records were found in this dataset
   directly linking Megasis/Etka to other sanctioned entities

4. The CLAP program (food distribution) appears to be the primary vehicle
   for Iran-Venezuela commercial activity, with Saab's ASASI FOOD FZE as
   a key conduit

5. Further investigation needed:
   - Venezuelan company registration records
   - Bank transaction records
   - Shipping manifests for Megasis/Etka
   - CLAP supplier contracts
